# Project Title: "Most Useless Button App"
## Project Overview:
**An app where there is only a single button with absolutely no purpose, but when you click the button, every time, you get a new silly fact, joke, or sound effect. It also tracks your number of button clicks and compares it to other users.**

## Key Features

- **Login System:**
Users will sign in and be able to save their button-clicking statistics.
- **Stupid Answers:**
The button brings back stupid answers like:
1. A random joke ("Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!")
2. A random sound effect (such as a duck quack, fart sound, or drum roll).
3. A random fact ("Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't!")
- **Leaderboard:**
Leaders of whom clicked the button the most.
- **Fun Stats:** Shows personal stats like "You've wasted 3 hours pressing this button."

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend:** React for the button UI and stats display.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js for serving button responses and tracking user stats.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user stats and leaderboard data.


## Why This Project:

It is super simple and silly, just perfect for testing backend concepts such as user login, database integration, and API calls.
The leaderboard feature is a great way to showcase real-time data updates.
